# Web Starter

A seed project to build web application with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Redux](http://rackt.github.io/redux/), [React Redux](https://github.com/rackt/react-redux), [React Router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router), [Immutable](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/), [Lodash](https://lodash.com/), and the [Babel Runtime](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/runtime/). All code and tests can be written in ES6/ES7.

### Usage
Run 'npm run' to see a list of available commands

'npm test' -> Run unit tests. Find all files under src ending with \*.spec.js and \*.spec.jsx and runs the tests in them. Use [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) to write the tests.

'npm run test:watch' -> For TDD. Run tests when a file is saved.

'npm run lint' -> Run [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) to lint code.

'npm run dev' -> Run development server with [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/). Uses [React Hot Loader](http://gaearon.github.io/react-hot-loader/).

'npm run prod'-> Build production version with [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/). Build is available under /builds/prod/.

'npm run pack' -> Package application with [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/). Produces a single HTML file (/builds/pack/index.html) that can be distributed.
